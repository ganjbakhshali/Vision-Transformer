# Vision-Transformer
Vision Transformer (ViT)

This repository contains an implementation of Vision Transformers (ViT), a state-of-the-art deep learning model for computer vision tasks. The notebook demonstrates step-by-step how Vision Transformers work and includes essential components such as data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Implementation**: The notebook provides a detailed implementation of the Vision Transformer architecture from scratch.
- **Data Handling**: Includes data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to prepare datasets for training.
- **Customizable Model**: Flexible parameters to adjust the transformer architecture.
- **Visualization**: Insights into model performance and attention mechanisms.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics to assess the model's effectiveness on a given dataset.

## Prerequisites

## Model Overview
The Vision Transformer leverages the power of transformers, originally designed for NLP tasks, to process image data. Key highlights of the model include:
- Splitting images into patches and treating them as sequence inputs.
- Embedding patches with positional information.
- Using multi-head self-attention to capture global relationships.
- Fine-tuning the architecture for specific tasks like image classification.

## Dataset
The notebook supports integration with standard datasets such as CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and custom datasets. Ensure that the dataset is properly formatted and accessible before training.

## Results
- Model accuracy and loss curves are visualized during training.
- Insights into the attention mechanisms using visualization tools.
